							<h2><b>Cosmology & Data Science</b></h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a cosmologist and assistant professor at the Institute for Astronomy (IfA) at the University of Hawai'i.  My research lies at the intersection of data analysis and theory.  I am interested in a wide range of topics, including large scale structure, gravitational lensing, the cosmic microwave background, cross-survey analyses, and statistical methods.  A particular focus of my work is developing new techniques to extract cosmological information from astronomical surveys.</p>

						 <p> Prior to joining the IfA, I was a Kavli Senior Fellow at the University of Cambridge and a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania.  I completed my PhD at the University of Chicago under the supervision of Prof. Scott Dodelson.</p>

			    <h2>Galaxies x CMB lensing</h2>
			    <p>
			      <h3>Overview</h3>
			      Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons have travelled across the entire observable Universe by the time they reach our telescopes.  During this journey, the paths of these photons are perturbed by the gravitational lensing effect of intervening structure. High-resolution CMB experiments can be used to estimate the lensing distortion, providing in essence a map of projected structure in the Universe between the observer and the last scattering surface from which the CMB originates.  I am interested in how CMB lensing measurements can be combined with overlapping measurements of low-redshift structure provided by galaxy surveys to improve cosmological constraints.  In particular, by cross-correlating galaxy surveys with CMB lensing, we can improve the precision of high-redshift measurements of the mass distribution, and increase the robustness of cosmological constraints to systematic uncertainties.

			    <h2>Galaxy clusters</h2>
			    <p>
			      <h3>Overview</h3>
			      Galaxy clusters are the most massive, gravitationally bound structures in the Universe.  Their extreme position on the halo mass function makes them highly sensitive probes of cosmological expansion and growth of structure.  However, in order to make use of clusters as cosmological probes, we must be able to measure their masses.  I am interested in developing techniques for cluster mass calibration, and in understanding potential biases to mass estimates.  This include exploring physical process inside and around galaxy clusters, like the so-called splashback effect and large-scale gas shocks.

			    <h2>Probing baryons with the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect</h2>
			    <p>
			      <h3>Overview</h3>
			      Uncertainty on the impacts of baryonic feedback on the matter distribution is currently a dominant systematic for weak lensing constraints on cosmology.  The thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, caused by CMB photons inverse Compton scattering with hot electrons, provides a powerful way to measure the gas distribution and understand the impacts of feedback.  By cross-correlating galaxy surveys with measurement of the SZ effect, we can constrain feedback models and study the evolution of diffuse gas over cosmic time.

    			    <p>
			      <h3>Overview</h3>
			      If dark matter is a new particle, dark matter particles may coexist with their anti-particles.  Indeed, many popular theories of dark matter have this property.  Annihilating dark matter particles and anti-particles could then produce gamma-rays that are detectable with telescopes.  I am interested in searching for this signal, and generally developing new approaches to analyzing gamma-ray data.

			    <h2>Cosmic tensions</h2>
			    <p>
			      <h3>Overview</h3>
			      The influx of data from current cosmological surveys is huge, and will grow by orders of magnitude with next generation surveys.  With the growing statistical power of these datasets, disagreements (a.k.a. tensions) have emerged between some cosmological probes.  Perhaps foremost among these is the Hubble tension, between direct measurements of the Hubble constant and measurements that rely on assumptions about early-time physics.  This tension could be signalling a problem with our currently favored cosmological model, or it could be indicative of poorly understood systematic errors.  I am interested in developing techniques to assess tension in/between cosmological measurements, and in investigating the nature of recent cosmological tensions.

			      <h3>Overview</h3>
			      I am broadly intested in applying novel statistical techniques to extract information from data.  Most recently, I have worked on how to extract information from the diffuse gamma-ray background using likelihood-free (i.e. simulation based) inference methods, particularly posterior density estimation with so-called flow models.  I am also working on methods to extract information about baryonic feedback from measurements of the Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect using e.g. deep neural networks and symbolic regression.
