My research is driven by some of the big, unanswered questions in
cosmology.  Are tensions between the results of several recent cosmological surveys
indicating a problem with the standard cosmological model, or are they caused by
systematic errors?  Is our understanding of structure formation
correct, and can we accurately model the structures of the most
massive dark matter halos in the Universe?  What are the processes
that drive astrophysical feedback?  Very broadly, I am interested in
developing and implementing new methods to answer these questions
using galaxy surveys, cosmic microwave background surveys, and
cross-correlations between the two.  I especially enjoy developing
novel approaches to extract science from data; in general, my work
tends to lie at the intersection of data analysis and theory.

I am currently a Kavli Senior Fellow in the Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.  Before arriving at Cambridge, I was a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania.  And before that, I did a PhD at the
University of Chicago under the supervision of Prof. Scott Dodelson.  In January, I'll be moving to the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii.
