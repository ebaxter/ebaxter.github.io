<br>
Broadly, my research is motivated by some of the big, unanswered questions facing cosmologists today.  Are <b>tensions</b> between the results of several recent cosmological surveys
indicating a problem with the standard cosmological model, or are they caused by
systematic errors?  Is our understanding of <b>structure formation</b>
correct, and can we accurately model the structures of the most
massive <b>dark matter halos</b> in the Universe?  What are the processes
that drive astrophysical feedback and control <b>galaxy formation</b>?  I am particularly interested in
developing and implementing new methods to answer these questions
using galaxy surveys, cosmic microwave background surveys, and
<b>cross-correlations</b> between the two.  Beyond these cosmology-related topics, I am interested in thinking about new applications of astronomical surveys and challenging data analysis questions.   My work tends to lie at the intersection of data analysis and theory.

I am an assistant professor at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu.  Before that I was briefly a Kavli Senior Fellow in the Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge, and before that a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania.  I completed my PhD at the
University of Chicago under the supervision of Prof. Scott Dodelson.
